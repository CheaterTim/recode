recode is a utility-focused fabric mod for [DiamondFire](https://mcdiamondfire.com/home/) to make development more fun. It is the official successor to [CodeUtilities](https://github.com/CodeUtilities/CodeUtilities-2.0), from which it was cloned.

You can find the mod jar [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/recode/versions). Future plans include removing bloat/unnecessary features, improving existing code, adding new features, and migrating to Kotlin.

## Features

DiamondFire is a Minecraft server where you can create your own minigames with code. recode seeks to improve the DF experience beyond the limitations of a server plugin. All features in the mod are toggleable to provide everyone with the modular experience they prefer most.

- Utility commands to supercharge your code, such as importing Note Block Studio files as Code Templates
- Automation of frequently used commands, such as `/resetcompact` and `/chat local`
- DiamondFire-specific keybinds
- The ability to hide messages you don't want
- Additional HUDs, such as the LagSlayer HUD to keep your action bar free
- An additional Sided Chat to partition your messages
- And much more!
